1.2.6 to 1.2.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If the ifIndex of an interface on a device changes, it is possible
  that an interface with an IP address that is set for collection
  could be set to not collect. This has been fixed.
- If using the new SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 services, the problem listed
  below for 1.2.6 where interfaces set for C get set to N during
  a rescan would occur. This has been fixed.

  interfaces.

- When choosing to select SNMP data collection for a node, once the
  changes are applied the web page will go back to the node instead
  of the main Admin page. This improves performance on large systems.

  set to "N" on a rescan.
- Upgraded MX4J to 3.0.1 (the same version in head) to fix bug #1330.

  outages and does not require a reboot when unmanaging a service.

  respectively).  Thanks to Jonathan Sartin who submitted a patch.  Bug 1331.

  proper timestamps
- many database indexes added for better table performance
- many SNMP data collection bugfixes (default storageflag is now
