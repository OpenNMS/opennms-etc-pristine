  of places for path-handling.
- Allow "-" in service and category names (bug #697)
- Allow specifying a timeout for status on startup (opennms -c)
- Add a convenience script for testing NSClient connections
  ($OPENNMS_HOME/bin/checknsc)
- Moved StrafePing to it's own own package since it can cause a lot
  of I/O when doing response-time collection; to re-enable it, add
  your ranges to the strafer package in poller-configuration.xml.
- Added some performance-enhancing indexes to the database.
- Added SNMP trap definitions and data collection for IPUnity,
  Convergence, and MRV devices.
- Many linkd improvements.

- Reworked the installer to be a little more verbose in what it's
  attempting (and if it fails), see install -h for options
- Use jsch for a new SSH poller (bug #782)
- Configurably allow treating "no route to host" or "connection
  refused" as hard or soft errors. (bug #904)
- The outages display on the front page now tells how long the outage
  has been occurring. (bug #1552)
- The Jetty daemon is now more versatile, with support for setting
  the listen address, as well as the base URL for proxying behind
  mod_proxy (bug #2064)
- Unified (to some extent) the opennms.properties and webapp
  configuration.properties files.  The opennms.properties file is now
  the canonical location for configuration, and
  WEB-INF/configuration.properties overrides it's defaults.
- Added the ability to specific per report how many graphs to
  display in a KSC report.
- RSS feeds for events, alarms, outages, and notifications; see
  http://www.opennms.org/index.php/WebUI_RSS_Feeds
- fix bug where hitting [-] on some browser pages (alarm, etc.)
  caused an exception

1.3.6 to 1.3.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- huge performance updates in data collection and discovery

  on a page. The old one exists as list-long.jsp.
- The Postgresql iplike function is now it's own project.
- The clearKey field was added to make automations easier to use.
- Fixed Bug 1403 which was causing the issnmprimary field to be
  set to "N" for interfaces with IP addresses and no SNMP.
- Changed a large number of files to make defaults more reasonable.
  Big change in the way RRDs are installed. If there is historic
  data, be sure to merge these files correctly or else the RRD
  structure will change.

1.3.1 to 1.3.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Changed the way v2 traps are handled, we now do not take the first two 
  varbinds as parameters.  This is in accordance with RFC2089.  This is in 
  rev 4883 of SVN.  This should address bug 733.
- Add proxy-host support back into snmp-config.xml
- Notificatiaons can now reference %tticketid% to retrieve the ticket
  number from the event.  Auto resolving events now have all configured
  notification parameters.  Adds column to notifications called 
  notifConfigName which represents the name of the configured notification
  used to send the event.
- HTML fixes in the webUI per bug #1558.  Thanks Marc C Poulin
  <opennms@jawfish.com>!
- Data collection on arbitrary SNMP indexes is now supported.  See
  bug #504.
- Alarms now remove old events by default.  Use "auto-clean" attribute
  in eventconf files.  Files eventconf.xml and Standard.events.xml have
  been modified with this optional attribute.  Adjust to your requirements.
- Reordered the top offenders from worst to best.
- Added a date to the availability reports to choose which day to
  run.
- Added eventconf file for Pixel Metrics Traps/Notifications
- Added new partial object model to support new Importer integration
- Added new Importer service to be used in place of discovery and
- capabilities (Capsd) polling.  Runs on cron like schedule to import
- nodes, interfaces, services, and categories from an XML (see
  model-import.xsd)
- Added HTTP notification strategy.
- Add "Show/hide interfaces" link to the bottom of element/nodelist.jsp.
- Combine element/nodelist.jsp and element/nodelistonly.jsp in the webUI
  into a single page.  If the "listInterfaces" parameter is passed,
  interfaces will be shown for each node, otherwise, just nodes are shown.
- Significantly improved RTC startup time. (DB with 40K nodes and 30
  categories configured took 3.5 hours to init RTCd.  With improvements,
  time now < 2 minutes) (way to go brozow!)
- Improved category feature with new category_node and categories
  tables along with new database-schema.xml file.  Use categoryName
  now in your filter rules by populating categories and category_node
  tables appropriately.
- Changed snmpIfSpeed in the snmpinterface table to a bigint and made
  appropriate int->long and Integer->Long changes refering to ifSpeed
  Changed installer to not pg_dump using "-D" flag.  Be sure to run 
  the installer with the "-disU" option.  DJ - change this
  back if you see fit. Bug 1398.
- Added support for range attribute in threshd packages. When specified
  this will fetch the last non NaN value from an rrd between now and
  now minus range. Bug 1432.
- Added SNMP system definition for Powerware UPSes (OID mask
  .1.3.6.1.4.1.534.).  Thanks to Sean McAvoy <seanmcavoy@gmail.com>.
- Added asset info to the node page and some SNMP-Informant collections.
- Changed OpenNMS so that manage/unmange interfaces deletes active
  outages and does not require a reboot when unmanaging a service.
- Fixed an issue with the Scheduled Outages GUI and Java 5.
- Fixed an issue with data collection when the primary interface is
  on a NIC with other virtual IPs.
- Pull navbar from the top and bottom of the web pages into its own include
  file and use a bean to drive its operation instead of a ton of if statements.
- Pull ant filter replacements out of the web app from {header,footer}.jsp
  and about.jsp.  Use configuration.properties/Vault.getProperty() and
  Vault.homeDir() instead.
- More CSS-ification of the webapp.  Clean up the formatting of styles.ccs.
- Add a standalone ping utility to org.opennms.protocols.icmp.IcmpSocket.
  To use, do a "sh build.sh jar" and then execute this as root:
      java -Dopennms.library.jicmp=`pwd`/work/jicmp/libjicmp.* \
          -cp work/jar/opennms_services.jar \
          org.opennms.protocols.icmp.IcmpSocket <host>
  Note: the libjicmp.* part matches the libjicmp shared library name,
  no matter what the architecture.  The specific library is libjicmp.so
  on most platforms and libjicmp.jnilib on Mac OS X.
- Add NSClient capsd plugin and poller monitor written by Matt Raykowski,
  <matt.raykowski@gmail.com>.  Thanks, Matt!  Enhancement bug #1389.

- Add CentOS 4 support to the RPM spec file.  Bug #1222.  Thanks
  Ted Kaczmarek <tedkaz@optonline.net>.
- Fix the arguments to "find" in runjava.  It should now work properly on
  Mandrake Linux.  Bug #1205.  Thanks Chris Goheen <cg@sonic.net> for
  reporting this.
- Remove the Java dependency from the RPM package.  Of the Java packages
  out there, there is no common package name or virtual package name.
  We'll let 'runjava' do the dependency checking.  Bug #1144.  Thanks
  Ted Kaczmarek <tedkaz@optonline.net> for pointing out that we should
  try to use virtual packages.
- Remove the excludes for the compilation of JSP code from Java source to
  class files.  Anything ending in '.jsp' is now compiled.  The following
  two cleanups below made this possible.
- Reorganize the filesystem layout of the webapp to fit the Sun JSP code
  conventions.  Nothing in the actual files was changed, except for
  pathnames that pointed at files which ave moved.  Reference:
  http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javaserverpages/\
	code_convention/
- Remove the eventconf editor from the webapp as it didn't compile.
  Opened up enhancement bug #1212 suggesting that this be resurrected
  and fixed at some point.
- Add enhanced oncall-schedules to users.xsd and UserManager
- Modify java code and build to use new castor-0.9.6 rather than the older
  version.  New version depends on commons-logging.jar. 
- Added commons-logging.jar to build in lib.
- Chage the build to castorbuilder.properties is passed correctly.  properties
  target of task fails to properly set it.
- Revised build-castor.xml to make use of macros also made cleanImports run
  only if an xsd was processed
- Revised build-sablecc.xml so cleanImports runs only if the .java files are 
  generated.
- Modified Eclipse project to exclude installer.properties and MANIFEST.MF when
  building as these need to pass thru ant token filters.
- Rearrange ant libraries to add more control over the ant classpath
  in preparation for modifying castor xsd source generation.  This included
  fixing eclipse builders and tool launchers.
- Changed default EclipseBuilder to 31M5GenSource that generates sablecc and
  castor code directly using ant without an intervening script.  May require
  Eclipse 3.1M5.  You can reenable the old one (GenerateSouce) under
   Project -> Properties -> Builders
- Added roles to users.xml and extend notifd to send notifications to 
  users scheduled for that role.
- Use RPM "virtual packages" for the Java dependency.  Bug 1144.  Thanks
  Ted Kaczmarek <tedkaz@optonline.net>.
- Add "jsp.compile" target (and other associated targets) that compile
  JSP files into Java source code and compile the resulting code into
  Java classes.  Useful for testing if a change to a JSP caused anything
  to break.  Will also allow us to unit test them in the future.
- Moved servlet.jar from lib to devlib.  We shouldn't be distributing
  this with binary builds.  Bug 1146. 
- De-singletonized Eventd for jUnit test framework
- Added support the new notion of Alarms vs. Events

- Changed JavaMailer to only send mime mult-part message if a file
  attachment is required.
- Added pause code to Schedule class
- Created OpenNMSTestCase base class for JUnit testing.

  discovery (capsd) and monitoring (poller) support v3.
- Enhanced snmp-config.xml with new attributes to support SNMPv3
  as well as a new <ip-match> tag that behaves just as the IPLIKE
  so users have more flexibility specifying SNMP settings. 
- Modified SNMP plugins and monitors to rely more heavily on snmp-config.xml.
- Clearified the behavior of the SnmpPeerFactory constructor that takes
  the SNMP version argument to be one of "requested version" vs. "required".
- Moved capsd plugins to a separate package from capsd.
- fix namespaces issue with marshalled reports
- Added a zoom function to the performance results page.  Click on the graph 
  that you would like to interact with.  Then click drag for the time fram to 
  examine. This is still in the experimental phase, it works well FireFox and 
  IE, not with Konquerer or Safari
- Merged feature-xmlrpc-branch.  This includes enhancements made to the XML-RPC
  API as well as a new HttpMonitor that allows for virtual host, url, and page
  content matching; litterals as well as reqular expressions.
